# Categories of single-sorted higher-order categories

This file defines the large categories whose objects are single-sorted categories, 2-categories,
$n$-categories, and $\omega$-categories, with functors as morphisms.

## Implementation notes

The "Family" structures (`SingleSortedCategoriesFamily`, `SingleSorted2CategoriesFamily`, etc.)
extend `ObjectsFamily` and carry the appropriate type class instance. These families serve as the
objects of the corresponding large categories. The large category instances use `LargeCategory`
from Mathlib's category theory library, with functors as morphisms and functor composition as
the composition operation.
